# Stock market sentiment analysis 

StockTwits is a social media platform dedicated specifically for investors and traders alike. I used tweet messages to determine if the sentiment was good (bullish) or bad (bearish) using LSTMs and word embeddings to reduce dimensionality of word vectors. The resulting accuracy was ~72%. 

The hope is to develop a good predictive model to use this as information to invest in a particular stock/industry, depending on the tweet.
